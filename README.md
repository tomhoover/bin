# ~/bin

- All user-created scripts in ~/bin to start with a comma.

  This trick is taken from Brandon Rhodes's talk
  [Activation Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pybtvFFRYFs).
  Renaming scripts this way ensures easy access by pressing ',<TAB>',
  as well as differentiating between 'system' and 'user' programs.
